My last and first blog was answering the question: why is it important for a software engineer to keep a blog. Now, I would like to highlight how incredible simple and easy is to setup one nowadays. Already in the past create and maintain a blog was affordable by everyone with a minimum technical background and just some interest on the topic. But now, it is even more simpler. I had setup one in an evening for free, without having experience on web development. The receipt that worked fine for me is a mix of:

- GitHub Pages
- Markdown
- Jekyll
- Beautiful Jekyll

I feel that with this combination I get the benefit of a powerful and flexible solution, without spending effort in implementation details. So, I could focus on just the content and not on the tools itself.

### GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) offer a way to create custom websites for GitHub users and projects. It is a well known product and with a long history, since is already available from 2008. Its main benefits is simplicity. You have for free all the features of GitHub, like:

- version control
- availability
- lot of documentation
- huge community support
- don't need any infrastructure or database

If you want your custom domain, it support custom urls. And last but not least, as a software engineer you likely already have an account and have some repos on GitHub.
