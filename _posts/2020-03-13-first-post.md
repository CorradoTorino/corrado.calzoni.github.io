It is a long time since I started thinking of maintaining a blog. However, I never did a step forward in this direction for several reasons, probably the same that I share with tens of other developers.

These are the main ones: 

1. I don't have too much to share
2. I'm not a good writer
3. People are not interested in reading my stuffs
4. I'm too busy and already investing lot of my precious and scarce free time learning and growing as software engineer

However, my last reticence has been washed away when reading the book "The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride", where Sandro Mancuso dismantles one by one all my alibis. In fact, if I rethink better on the previous points:

1. *I don't have too much to share*

   Is it true? As software engineer, I learn new things in a daily basis. So, at least every week I can have something to share. No matter as small is the topic, it is probably a lesson learnt worth to be shared.  

2. *I'm not a good writer*

   That's ok! And I will never a good one without practice. Maintaining a blog can help me to develop writing muscle memory and to sharp my communication skills.

3. *People are not interested in reading my stuffs*

   Maybe not. However, I first write for myself. In particular for myself of the past. Who can explain things to me better than myself . Each of my learning has been a journey and some of them were upward ones. What if I can give some tips to myself of the past and let him enjoy a better journey? At the end, tens of developers are starting every day a similar journey as mine again and again .

4. *I'm too busy and I'm already investing a lot of my precious and scarce free time learning and growing as software engineer* 

   Yes It's true. I'm already reading books, blogs and technical sites, listening podcasts, watching videos, attending meetups, practicing katas. However, as Richard Feynman says "If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it". And a blog can be a great record to persist and ensure my learnings and progressions.

So, now I already wrote my first blog post about the importance of maintain a blog.  Moreover, I have a Trello board full of topics and ideas for the next posts. Then, let's see if I will be persistent enough to continue regularly with my blogging experience.
