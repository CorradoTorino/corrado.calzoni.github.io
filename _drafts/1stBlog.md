It is a long time since I started thinking about maintain a blog. However, I never did a step forward for several reasons, probably the same reasons that I share with tons of other developers: 

1. I don't have too much to share
2. I'm not a good writer
3. People are not interested in reading my stuffs
4. I'm too busy and I'm already investing a lot of my precious and scares free time learning and growing as software engineer 

However, my last reticence has been washed away when reading the book "The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride", where Sandro Mancuso dismantles one by one all my points. In fact, if I think better:

1. As software engineer, I learn new things in a daily basis. So, at least every week I can have something to share. No matter as small is the topic, it is probably a lesson learnt worth to be shared.  
2. For sure, but I will never a good writer if I'm not going to practice. Maintaining a blog can help me to develop writing muscle memory and sharp my communication skill.
3. Maybe not. However, I first write for my self. In particular for my self of the past and I know how to explain thing to myself. Each of my learnings has been a journey and some of them were turbulent ones. What if I can give some tips to my self of the past and let him enjoy a better journey? At the end, every day tens of developers as me are starting a similar journey again and again.
4. Yes It's true. I'm already reading books, blogs and technical sites, listening podcasts, watching videos, attending meetups, practicing katas. However, as Richard Feynman says "If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it". And a blog can be a great record to ensure my learnings and progressions.

 from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf/

 the best moment to teach something is right after you’ve learned it, because you remember how not knowing about it feels.
 They say you never fully understand a topic until you are able to explain it. 
 some advices:

 Be consistent with the topic. Don’t just rant about everything that comes to mind. Keep it professional.
 Show up consistently

 Have a list of post ideas

 Read books. Read blog posts. Read Twitter. Listen to podcasts

 Don’t think of it as a blog. See it as your own media platform, whose only purpose is to broadcast information that drives sales — https://twitter.com/pryelluw

 Help them by writing for them.
